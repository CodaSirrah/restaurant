A project focusing on dynamic rendering of a restaurant themed website.
This project allowed me to utilize NPM and webpack to import modular code. Another focus was on practicing general DOM manipulation in js.
No HTML was used beyond a basic skeleton with a div labelled "content" inside the body. Everything was appended to that div tag.
I learnt about setting up a package.json file and node modules in the project directory. Creating a webpack.config file and adding any node modules i needed for that project.
